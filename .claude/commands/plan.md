# Plan — design expensive, execute cheap

You are the planning specialist. This command runs on the most capable model deliberately: the thinking happens here, the execution happens later on cheaper models (`/lfg` on Opus, layer specialists on Sonnet). That split only works if the plan is **self-contained** — an executor with none of this session's context must be able to implement it without guessing.

## Output mode from $ARGUMENTS

| $ARGUMENTS starts with | Artifact |
|------------------------|----------|
| `issue` | GitHub issue (default — feeds directly into `/lfg <issue-number>`) |
| `md` or `file` | Markdown file at `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` (date from `date +%F`) |
| anything else | GitHub issue |

## Hard constraints

- **Read-only for source code.** Never edit application code, never commit, never create branches. The only file you may Write is a new plan markdown under `docs/plans/`.
- **Never reproduce secrets** (keys, tokens, credentials) in the plan, even redacted ones you encounter while reading config.
- **Dedupe before creating an issue**: `gh issue list --search "<keywords>"` — if an existing issue covers this, extend it in your summary instead of duplicating.

## Phase 1 — Investigate

Protect this session's context: delegate mechanical exploration to cheaper subagents and keep Fable for judgment.

1. Fan out Explore agents (`model: haiku`) for file discovery and naming-convention sweeps; use `model: sonnet` agents when a subsystem needs to be read and summarized. Launch independent explorations in parallel.
2. Read the load-bearing files yourself — the ones the design decision actually hinges on. Don't design from subagent summaries alone.
3. Check AGENTS.md and any layer-specific CLAUDE.md files for past decisions and gotchas.
4. Check `git log` for recent related work; the design should extend it, not fight it.

## Phase 2 — Design

- Develop 2–3 candidate approaches with real tradeoffs. Pick one and say why; record why the others lost.
- The chosen design must respect project invariants: Phlex components inheriting from DaisyUI::Base, register_modifiers with responsive comments, TDD (specs named before implementation steps), MCP server for DaisyUI class verification.
- Decide the test strategy: unit specs for gem components in `spec/lib/daisy_ui/`, request/system specs for docs.

## Phase 3 — Emit the plan artifact

Use this structure for the issue body or markdown file. Every section is load-bearing — an executor uses Context to avoid re-discovery, Steps to act, Gates to verify, Boundaries to stop.

```markdown
# <Title>

## Problem / Goal
<What's wrong or missing, who it affects, what done looks like.>

## Context (read these first)
<Bullet list: `path/to/file.rb` — why it matters to this change. Include components, specs, docs examples, base class. Self-contained: no references to "as discussed" or this session.>

## Decision
<Chosen approach and rationale. Then: alternatives considered and why each was rejected.>

## Implementation steps
<Ordered, small, each mapped to a specialist where useful (/add-component, /check-component, /tdd). Specs come before the code they cover. Name exact files to create or change.>

## Verification gates
<Exact commands + expected outcome:>
- `bundle exec rspec` — all green (gem)
- `cd docs && bundle exec rspec` — all green (docs)
- `bundle exec rubocop` — no offenses
- `cd docs && bin/rubocop` — no offenses

## Out of scope
<Explicit boundaries — the adjacent things an eager executor must NOT do.>

## Execution
Execute with `/lfg <issue-number>` (or `/lfg docs/plans/<file>.md`).
```

For GitHub issues: create with `gh issue create --title "..." --body "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"` — single-quoted heredoc delimiter. Apply the `plan` label if it exists (`gh label list`); don't create labels.

For markdown files: Write to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`. Leave it uncommitted — committing is the user's call.

## Phase 4 — Handoff

Report back: link to the issue (or file path), the chosen approach in 2–3 sentences, and the exact execute command. Stop there — do not start implementing.
